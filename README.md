- [Specmatic Website](https://specmatic.io)
- [Specmatic Documentation](https://specmatic.io/documentation.html)

This sample project illustrates the implementation of contract-driven development and contract testing within a Nodejs(Express) application. In this context, Specmatic is utilized to function as a client, making calls to API service according to its OpenAPI specification to validate its functionality.

Here is the API's [contract/open api spec](https://github.com/znsio/specmatic-order-contracts/blob/main/io/specmatic/examples/store/openapi/api_order_v3.yaml) governing the interaction of the client with the product API.
